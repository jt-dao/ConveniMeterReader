## ConveniMeterReader - IoT Adaptable and Affordable Home Smart Meter

Thank you for vieweing my project! For the latest code, please visit "jt_synopsys_v13.ino" and "finaltest.py"


ConveniMeterReader is an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype “hat-like” device that clips onto an existing meter to inexpensively convert it to a smart meter and consistently report readable usage data. The design is a battery powered embedded micro-controller device with a custom printed circuit board inside a water resistant case with a 3D-printed shroud shaped to sit over an existing meter. Tests confirm software periodically takes photos of the meter reading, crops/compresses the image, and transmits it using existing cellphone text message (SMS) infrastructure to the cloud where data is processed, effectively providing real-time water usage data wirelessly and remotely. Experimental measurements confirm it is IP67 waterproof and can potentially last for years on battery power.

ConveniMeterReader won multiple awards and over $200 in funds from science fair competitions, including 1st Award at the Synopsys Silicon Valley Championships, Honorable Mention/5th Place at the statewide California Science & Engineering Fair, 1st Place Valley Water HS award, and recognition from Ricoh Inc., the US Navy/Marine Crops, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
